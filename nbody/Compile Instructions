gcc "-IC:\\MinGW\\freeglut\\include\\" -O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o helloGL.o "..\\helloGL.c" 
gcc "-LC:\\MinGW\\freeglut\\lib\\" -o hellogl.exe helloGL.o nbodygl.o runGL.o -lopengl32 -lpthread -lglu32 -lfreeglut 

These are the 2 commands that it takes to compile this on my Windows computer - the -"IC..." paths are relative to my computer, but are necessary for getting openGL and Glut included in the build path on a windows machine at least

FOR LINUX COMPILE:
gcc -o nbody nbody.c -lpthread -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm

We have our program set up for 12 n-bodies - 8 planets, 1 sun, Pluto, Ceres the astroid, Our Moon. For a better view, change the nbodyData.txt first line to 6 - to read in the first 6 planets, which is much easier to see than trying to view all the planets because Pluto is wayyyyy out there and zooms out the screen
